# ChatBotBot


This is a project to try to give ChatGPT a robot body. 

Likely to start as a simple conversational device through a raspberry pi, but may continue to evolve over time by adding additional functionality.


Currently requires 
Whisper
DeepSpeech (likely to be removed) but used during initial development / evaluation.
